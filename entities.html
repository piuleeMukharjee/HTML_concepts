        <!-- HTML ENTITIES -->
        <!-- if we wannt to print reserved word in html webpage then we use html entities -->

        <!-- We can write it with two types -->
        <!--
            1. name:- 
                Sntax:- name,
                Ex:- lt,div&gt;
                output:- <div>
            
            2. Number:- 
                Syntax:- &#number;
                Ex:- &#60;div&#62;
                output:- <div>
            

            for Some example search on google 
            like for non breaking space we use &nbsp
                    Since no extra space is not allowed/showed in html page in website.
                    therefore we use non-breaking space for this.  
        -->
        <p>
            hello        how are you.<br>

            hello &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphow are you.

        <!-- Html symbol -->
        <!--
            it is important to use other symbol which is not in keyword.
            Ex:- dollar,pi,alpha,beta,gama,thita,phi.

            then we use entities again.
