            non semantic element are :-
            it does not clear the meaning that what want to do.
            
            Ex:-<div> and <span> nothing tell about its content.
                it is reappear for all but we cannot understand it as far we can learn attributes.
                
            semantic element:- 
            elements with meaning
                semantic elements clearly describre its meaning to both the browser and developer
    
            Example:- <form>,<table>, and <article>

                Some old non-semantic element in webpage 
                1. <div id="header">
                2. <div id="nav" >
                3. <div id="artical">
                4. <div id="selection">
                5. <div id="sidebar" >
                6. <div id="footer">

                    if we remove id(css element) the we does not able to differentiate between all div 

                solution:-

                New semantic elements in html5

                with div we use new rapper insted of div, we can also use div or both
                IF WE USE SYMANTICS RAPPER INSTEAD OF DIV

                1. <header>
                2. <nav>
                3. <artical>
                4. <section>
                5. <slidebar>
                6. <footer>
